# TFTP Server

***T***rivial ***F***ile ***T***ransfer ***P***rotocol (TFTP) is an application protocol that is used to transfer files between machines. It is very simple, hence the name *trivial*.

In this project, we are creating a server that handles only one client at a time. If you're unfamiliar with TFTP, please read about it [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1350https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1350).
